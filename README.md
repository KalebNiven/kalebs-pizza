THE PIZZA TASK
1. Task description  

Let’s imagine you want to start a new pizza delivery business. Please create a small web application for online pizza ordering. The idea is to make a non-existing service where assumed clients can choose a pizza, put it into a cart and make an order. 

2. Requirements  - The menu page should contain at least 8 pizzas-A login should be made availablefor checking the history of orders. Please make sure that the login option isnot mandatory for users (in other words, a user should be able to make an order without logging in)-Your clients should be able to choose pizzas directly from the menu-You can decide what else you want in the menu-Adding a description for each pizza would be a nice decision-Don’t proceed to the payment page. The last action from a client will be filling in the order form (address, name, surname, etc.) to get a confirmation that the order has been received-A client should be able to put several pizzas into cart, and the quantity must bedisplayed on the cart icon-Total price of each order must be calculated and shown in euros and in dollars. For instance, you can make a switch both in the menu and in the cart.  -Don’t forget to add delivery costs to the final bill. It can be a static figure

3. Technologies - You are free to use any frameworks or libraries, but keep in mind that we primarily evaluate interface, functionality and workflow-Less is more

 4. Delivery format  - Please provide a link to your repository and a direct link to the deployed version of your application (e.g. on Heroku)-The solution must be testable by a non-technical person  
 
 5. Resources  - Deployment of the application: any free hosting platform (e.g. Heroku) or your own server-UseGit as code source management tool (following Git Flow will be assessed
